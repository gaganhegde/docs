# Day 1 Operations

Day 1 Operations are actions that users take to bootstrap a GitOps system.   Bootstrapping GitOps can be done in one of the two commands.

* [odo pipelines bootstrap](../../commands/bootstrap)
* [oad pipelines init](../../commands/init)

These commands are similar.  They are differ in what gets genreated.  The boostrap command generated a functional GitOps setup including your first application.  The init command only generates CI/CD pipelines and associated resources.  This document describes how to bootstrap GitOps to deliver your first application.

## Prerequisites

You need to have the following installed in the OCP 4.x cluster.
* OpenShift Pipelines Operators
* [ArgoCD](prerequisites/argocd.md)
* [Sealed Secrets](prerequisites/sealed_secrets.md)

And, you will need this.
* Create [GitOps repository](prerequisites/gitops_repo.md)
* Source Git repository ([taxi](prerequisites/service_repo.md) is used as an example in this document)
* Download unofficial [odo](../../commands/bin) binary

## Bootstrapping the Manifest

```shell
$ odo pipelines bootstrap \
  --app-repo-url https://github.com/<username>/taxi.git \
  --app-webhook-secret testing \
  --gitops-repo-url https://github.com/<username>/gitops.git \
  --gitops-webhook-secret testing2 \
  --image-repo quay.io/<username>/taxi \
  --dockercfgjson ~/Downloads/<username>-auth.json \
  --prefix tst-
```

**NOTE**: DO NOT use `testing` and `testing2` as your secrets.

Per the [GitHub documentation](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/securing/)
you should generate a secret for each of them:

```shell
$ ruby -rsecurerandom -e 'puts SecureRandom.hex(20)'
```

| Option                  | Description |
| ----------------------- | ----------- |
| --app-repo              | This is the source code to your first application. |
| --app-webhook-secret    | Creates a secret used to validate incoming hooks. |
| --gitops-repo-url       | This is where your configuration and pipelines live. |
| --gitops-webhook-secret | This is used to validate incoming hooks. |
| --image-repo            | Where should we configure your builds to push to? |
| --dockercfgjson         | This is used to authenticate image pushes to your image-repo. |
| --prefix                | This is used to help separate user namespaces. |

## Exploring the manifest

The bootstrap process generates a fairly large number of files, including a
manifest describing your first application, and configuration for a complete CI
pipeline and deployments from ArgoCD.

```yaml
environments:
- apps:
  - name: taxi
    services:
    - taxi-svc
  name: tst-dev
  pipelines:
    integration:
      bindings:
      - github-pr-binding
      template: app-ci-template
  services:
  - name: taxi-svc
    source_url: https://github.com/<username>/taxi.git
    webhook:
      secret:
        name: github-webhook-secret-taxi-svc
        namespace: tst-cicd
- name: tst-stage
- cicd: true
  name: tst-cicd
- argo: true
  name: tst-argocd
gitops_url: https://github.com/<user name>/gitops.git
```

The bootstrap creates four environments, `dev`, `stage`, `cicd` and `argocd`
with a user-supplied prefix.

Namespaces are generated for the `dev`, `stage` and `cicd` environments.

The name of the app and service are derived from the last component of your
`app-repo-url` e.g. if your bootstrap with `--app-repo-url
https://github.com/myorg/myproject.git` this would bootstrap an app called
`myproject` and a service called `myproject-svc`.

## Environment configuration

The `tst-dev` environment created is the most visible configuration.

### configuring pipelines

```yaml
environments:
- apps:
  - name: taxi
    services:
    - taxi-svc
- name: tst-dev
  pipelines:
    integration:
      bindings:
      - github-pr-binding
      template: app-ci-template
  services:
  - name: taxi-svc
    source_url: https://github.com/wtam2018/taxi.git
    webhook:
      secret:
        name: github-webhook-secret-taxi-svc
        namespace: tst-cicd      
```

The `pipelines` key describes how to trigger a Tekton PipelineRun, the
`integration` binding and template are processed when a _Pull Request_
is opened.

This is the default pipeline specification for the `tst-dev` environment, you
can find the definitions for these in these two files:

 * [`environments/<prefix>cicd/base/pipelines/07-templates/app-ci-build-pr-template.yaml`](output/environments/tst-cicd/base/pipelines/07-templates/app-ci-build-pr-template.yaml)
 * [`environments/<prefix>cicd/base/pipelines/06-bindings/github-pr-binding.yaml`](output/environments/tst-cicd/base/pipelines/06-bindings/github-pr-binding.yaml)

By default this triggers a PipelineRun of this pipeline

 * [`environments/<prefix>cicd/base/pipelines/05-pipelines/app-ci-pipeline.yaml`](output/environments/tst-cicd/base/pipelines/05-pipelines/app-ci-pipeline.yaml)

These files are not managed directly by the manifest, you're free to change them
for your own needs, by default they use [Buildah](https://github.com/containers/buildah)
to trigger build, assuming that the Dockerfile for your application is in the root
of your repository.

### configuring services

```yaml
- apps:
  - name: taxi
    services:
    - taxi-svc
  services:
  - name: taxi-svc
    source_url: https://github.com/wtam2018/taxi.git
    webhook:
      secret:
        name: github-webhook-secret-taxi-svc
        namespace: tst-cicd    
```

The YAML above defines an app called `taxi`, which has a reference to service called `taxi-svc`.

The configuration for these is written out to:

 * [`environments/test-dev/services/taxi-svc/base/config/`](output/environments/tst-dev/services/taxi-svc/base/config)
 * [`environments/<prefix>dev/apps/taxi/base/`](output/environments/tst-dev/apps/taxi/base/)

The `taxi` app's configuration references the services configuration.

The `source_url` references the upstream repository for the service, this
coupled with the `webhook.secret` is also used to drive the CI pipeline, with a
hook confgured, changes to this repository will trigger the template and
binding), the secret is used to authenticate incoming hooks from GitHub.

## Bringing the bootstrapped environment up

First of all, let's get started with our Git repository.

From the root of your gitops directory (with the pipelines.yaml), execute the
following commands:

```shell
$ git init .
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Initial commit."
$ git remote add origin <insert gitops repo>
$ git push -u origin master
```

This should initialise the GitOps repository, this is the start of your journey
to deploying applications via Git.

Note: Workaround a OpenShift Route bug by removing the `Status:` field.

[`environments/<prefix>cicd/base/pipelines/09-routes/gitops-webhook-event-listener.yaml`](output/environments/tst-cicd/base/pipelines/09-routes/gitops-webhook-event-listener.yaml)

```yaml
apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: gitops-webhook-event-listener-route
  namespace: tst-cicd
spec:
  host: ""
  port:
    targetPort: 8080
  subdomain: ""
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: el-cicd-event-listener
    weight: 100
  wildcardPolicy: None
  ```
Next, we'll bring up our deployment infrastructure, this is only necessary at the
start, the configuration should be self-hosted thereafter.


```shell
$ oc apply -k environments/tst-dev/env/base
$ oc apply -k config/tst-argocd/config
$ oc apply -k config/tst-cicd/base
```

You should now be able to create a route to your new service, it should be
running [nginx](https://nginx.org/) and serving a page.

## Changing the initial deployment

The bootstrap creates a `Deployment` in `environments/<prefix>-dev/services/<service name>-svc/base/config/100-deployment.yaml` this should bring up nginx, this is purely for demo purposes, you'll need to change this to deploy your built image.

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
  - image: nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged:latest
    imagePullPolicy: Always
    name: taxi-svc
```

You'll want to replace this with the image for your application, if you've built
it.

## Your first CI run

Part of the configuration bootstraps a simple TektonCD pipeline for building code when a pull-request is opened.

You will need to create a new Webhook for the CI:

```shell
$ odo pipelines webhook create \
    --access-token <github user access token>
    --env-name tst-dev
    --service-name taxi-svc
```

Make a change to your application source, the `taxi` repo from the example, it
can be as simple as editing the `README.md` and propose a change as a
Pull Request.

This should trigger the PipelineRun:

![PipelineRun with succesful completion](img/pipelinerun-success.png)

Drilling into the PipelineRun we can see that it executed our single task:

![PipelineRun with steps](img/pipelinerun-succeeded-detail.png)

And finally, we can see the logs that the build completed and the image was
pushed:

![PipelineRun with logs](img/pipelinerun-succeeded-logs.png)

## Changing the default CI run

Before this next stage, we need to ensure that there's a Webhook configured for
the "gitops" repo.

```shell
$ odo pipelines webhook create \
    --access-token <github user access token>
    --cidi
```

This step involves changing the CI definition for your application code.

The default CI pipeline we provide is defined in the manifest file:

```yaml
  pipelines:
    integration:
      bindings:
      - github-pr-binding
      template: app-ci-template
```

This template drives a Pipeline that is stored in this file:

 * [`environments/<prefix>cicd/base/pipelines/05-pipelines/app-ci-pipeline.yaml`](output/environments/tst-cicd/base/pipelines/05-pipelines/app-ci-pipeline.yaml)

An abridged version is shown below, it has a single task `build-image`, which
executes the `buildah` task, which basically builds the source and generates an
image and pushes it to your image-repo.

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Pipeline
spec:
  resources:
  - name: source-repo
    type: git
  tasks:
  - name: build-image
      inputs:
      - name: source
        resource: source-repo
    taskRef:
      kind: ClusterTask
      name: buildah
```

Normally, you'd at least run a simple test of the code before you build the
code:

Write the following Task to this file:

 * `environments/<prefix>cicd/base/pipelines/04-tasks/go-test-task.yaml`

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: go-test
  namespace: tst-cicd
spec:
  inputs:
    resources:
    - name: source
      description: the git source to execute on
      type: git
  steps:
    - name: go-test
      image: golang:latest
      command: ["go", "test", "./..."]
```

This is a simple test task for a Go application, it just runs the tests.

Update the pipeline in this file:

 * [`environments/<prefix>cicd/base/pipelines/05-pipelines/app-ci-pipeline.yaml`](output/environments/tst-cicd/base/pipelines/05-pipelines/app-ci-pipeline.yaml)


```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Pipeline
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: app-ci-pipeline
  namespace: tst-cicd
spec:
  params:
  - name: REPO
    type: string
  - name: COMMIT_SHA
    type: string
  resources:
  - name: source-repo
    type: git
  - name: runtime-image
    type: image
  tasks:
  - name: go-ci
    resources:
      inputs:
      - name: source
        resource: source-repo
    taskRef:
      kind: Task
      name: go-test
  - name: build-image
    runAfter:
      - go-ci
    params:
    - name: TLSVERIFY
      value: "true"
    resources:
      inputs:
      - name: source
        resource: source-repo
      outputs:
      - name: image
        resource: runtime-image
    taskRef:
      kind: ClusterTask
      name: buildah
```

Commit and push this code, and open a Pull Request, you should see a PipelineRun
being executed.

![PipelineRun doing a dry run of the configuration](img/pipelinerun-dryrun.png)

This validates that the YAML can be applied, by executing a `kubectl apply --dry-run`.
